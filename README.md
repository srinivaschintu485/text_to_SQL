# SQL Query Generation with Fine-Tuned Language Models

This project demonstrates how to use a fine-tuned language model for generating SQL queries based on a given database schema and SQL-related prompts. The model is trained to convert natural language SQL prompts into valid SQL queries, which are then returned with explanations.

**Features**

SQL Query Generation: The model can generate SQL queries based on specific tasks and input SQL prompts.

Customizable Database Schema: You can define a custom database schema to represent tables and their relationships.

Inferred SQL Queries: Given a prompt, the model infers and constructs an appropriate SQL query.

**Workflow**

**Fine-Tuned Model:** The model is pre-trained with a dataset containing SQL prompts and their corresponding queries, which helps the model generate accurate SQL queries based on input prompts.

**Tokenization:** The input prompt and database schema are tokenized and converted into numerical tokens that the model can process.

**Response Generation:** The model uses its trained knowledge to generate a SQL query in response to the given SQL prompt. Various parameters such as temperature and top_p can control the randomness and creativity of the output.

**Post-Processing:** After generating the output, the SQL query and the explanation of the query are extracted from the model's response and displayed as the final result.

**Use Cases**
**SQL Query Automation:** Automatically generate SQL queries for data extraction, reporting, and analysis based on user queries.

**Database Analytics:** Quickly generate SQL queries for aggregations, joins, filtering, and other database operations.

**SQL Query Learning Tool:** Use the model as an educational tool to help learn SQL syntax and query writing by example.

**Model**
The model used in this project has been fine-tuned using various SQL-related datasets and is optimized to generate correct and efficient SQL queries. It utilizes advanced techniques like LoRA adapters for enhancing model performance with efficient memory usage.

**Requirements**
The project requires the following libraries:

**Transformers:** For loading and interacting with the pre-trained language model.

**Unsloth:** For optimizing inference speed.

**PyTorch:** For deep learning model training and inference.

**Future Enhancements**
**Extended Query Types:** Implement more advanced queries involving subqueries, window functions, and more complex operations.

**Interactive Interface:** Create a web interface where users can input SQL-related prompts and view generated queries in real-time.
